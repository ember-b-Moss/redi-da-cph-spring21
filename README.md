# Installation/Setup
##Python
We recommend you use the Anaconda distribution of Python. You can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) 
and find installation instructions for Windows, MacOS and Linux [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). If you already have Python on your computer, great! 
For this course, we recommend you have at least Python 3.4 installed. 
Anaconda is a python distribution that comes together with hundreds of packages of which we will use some 
during this course. If you’re curious about Anaconda, the wikipedia article is very informative.

##Git / Github
Git is a version control system which you will be using to store the projects you are working 
on during the course and to download the course material. 
You can find an installation guide [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
Github is a code hosting platform where we will make the course material available for you. The best way to
interact with Github is using git in your terminal. You can create an account [here](https://github.com/).
We will give an introduction to git and Github in the first class, so don’t worry if you don’t know what 
to do after you have installed git and created an account on Github. We encourage you to browse around Github
 to get familiar with it.
